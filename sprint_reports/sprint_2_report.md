# Sprint 2 Report

## What's New (User Facing)

- Database backend for cart, product, payment, sign in, and order management
- create profile page
- sign in page
- e commerce analytics page
- admin profile page

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

This week our team accomplished various aspects of the frontend and backend. We finished implementing the majority of the database backend, with only functionality related to order management remaining. We also finished implementing four major pages.

## Unfinished Work

This week, Camden did not have time to work on the project. This means all his issues remain (user profile, order history, wishlist). As well, we have database order management issues remaining. There are also a variety of pages that still need to be hooked up to the database backend.

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:

- We were able to finish the majority of the database backend. There are now just a few remaining functionalities. As well, we were able to seamlessly incorporate those database functionalities into the front end for many pages.
    
Here's what we'd like to improve:

- In the next sprint, we would like to improve the output of some team members. Some team members were not able to get work done this sprint due to personal conflict. More communication is needed to let other team members know when this is the case.
    
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:

- More frequent updates to team members.
- More output/documentation from team members.
