## What's New (User Facing)

* Database backend for customer account creation
* Database backend for admin account creation
* Database backend for product details updation and deletion
* Home screen that displays products
* User profile page
* Wish list page

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

This week, our team accomplished various aspects of the front end and backend. We followed a divide-and-conquer approach where some team members focused on backend, and other front end. As such, much of the major components of the website have been implemented. Leaving the task of linking together these components into a concrete implementation remaining.

## Unfinished Work


At this point, we have some unfinished work on the front end regarding admin and customer profile pages. This is because many of the front end issues require other issues to be completed before they can. This has to do with the fact that the user interface must be integrated with the database backend. However, because we are iteratively building out the backend in conjunction with the front end, this means some front end features must wait until the backend is more build out.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
    
- By following a divide-and-conquer approach, we are able to easily work on different components of the project asynchronously.
- Our initial planning and team organization outlined concrete goals for the sprint.
    
Here's what we'd like to improve:
- Organization regarding documentation on the kanban board.
- Organization regarding expectations about time of completion for team member roles.
    
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:

- More frequent documentation of the kanban baord so as to not lose track of any progress along the way.
- More frequent status updates to team members.
