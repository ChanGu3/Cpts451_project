# Sprint 3 Report

## What's New (User Facing)

- Database backend for payment methods and creating order transactions.
- Product page
- Main page

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

This week, we completed the database backend for payment method and order management. These changes were integrated into the front end. As well, we stylized the UI for a more polished user experience.

## Unfinished Work

Camden abandonded participating in this project after sprint 1. As such, his assigned issues (user profile, order history, and wishlist) remain unfinished. All unfinished work reflects entirely on Camden.

## Completed Issues/User Stories

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:

- For the active team members, we were able to complete all issues assigned at the begining of the project. We gained a better sense for how to collaborate in a group, and expanded our communication skills and comradery.

Here's what we'd like to improve:

- Camden's lack of participation set back major features from being developed. Sometimes life throws us curveballs, and we must adjust. But it would have been prefered if Camden communicated his situation with the team earlier so we could have adjusted our workflow earlier to account for his absence.
